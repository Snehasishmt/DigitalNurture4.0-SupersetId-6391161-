Exercise 6: Cursors
Scenario 2: Apply annual fee to all accounts.
Question: Write a PL/SQL block using an explicit cursor ApplyAnnualFee that deducts an annual maintenance fee from the balance of all accounts.


DECLARE
   CURSOR ApplyAnnualFee IS
      SELECT AccountID, Balance FROM Accounts;

   v_fee CONSTANT NUMBER := 100;

BEGIN
   FOR rec IN ApplyAnnualFee 
   LOOP
      UPDATE Accounts
      SET Balance = Balance - v_fee,
          LastModified = SYSDATE
      WHERE AccountID = rec.AccountID;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Annual fee of ' || v_fee || ' deducted from Account ID: ' || rec.AccountID);
   END LOOP;

   COMMIT;
END;
