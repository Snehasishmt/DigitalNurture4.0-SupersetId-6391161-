Exercise 6: Cursors
Scenario 3: Update the interest rate for all loans based on a new policy.
Question: Write a PL/SQL block using an explicit cursor UpdateLoanInterestRates that fetches all loans and updates their interest rates based on the new policy.


DECLARE
   CURSOR UpdateLoanInterestRates IS
      SELECT LoanID, LoanAmount, InterestRate FROM Loans;

   v_new_rate NUMBER;
BEGIN
   FOR rec IN UpdateLoanInterestRates 
   LOOP
      IF rec.LoanAmount > 100000 THEN
         v_new_rate := rec.InterestRate - 1;
      ELSE
         v_new_rate := rec.InterestRate + 0.5;
      END IF;
      UPDATE Loans
      SET InterestRate = v_new_rate
      WHERE LoanID = rec.LoanID;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Loan ID: ' || rec.LoanID || ', Old Rate: ' || rec.InterestRate || ', New Rate: ' || v_new_rate);
   END LOOP;
   COMMIT;
END;
