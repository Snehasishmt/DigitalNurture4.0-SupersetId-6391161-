   FOR rec IN savings_cur 
   LOOP
      v_new_balance := rec.Balance * 1.01;
      UPDATE Accounts
      SET Balance = v_new_balance,
          LastModified = SYSDATE
      WHERE AccountID = rec.AccountID;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Interest applied to Account ID: ' || rec.AccountID || ', New Balance: ' || v_new_balance);
   END LOOP;
   COMMIT;
