Exercise 1: Control Structures

Scenario 2: A customer can be promoted to VIP status based on their balance.
Question: Write a PL/SQL block that iterates through all customers and sets a flag IsVIP to TRUE for those with a balance over $10,000

BEGIN
    FOR REC IN(SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS) LOOP
      IF REC.BALANCE > 10000 THEN
        UPDATE CUSTOMERS
        SET IS_VIP='TRUE'
        WHERE CUSTOMERID=REC.CUSTOMERID;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('VIP status granted to Customer ID: ' || REC.CUSTOMERID);
      ELSE
        UPDATE CUSTOMERS
        SET IS_VIP=''
        WHERE CUSTOMERID=REC.CUSTOMERID;
    END IF;
   END LOOP;
   COMMIT;
END;
