Exercise 1: Control Structures
Scenario 1: The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.


BEGIN
    FOR REC IN (
        SELECT C.CUSTOMERID, C.DOB, L.LOANID, L.INTERESTRATE
        FROM CUSTOMERS C
        INNER JOIN LOANS L ON C.CUSTOMERID = L.CUSTOMERID
    ) LOOP
        IF TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, REC.DOB)/12) > 60 THEN
            UPDATE LOANS
            SET INTERESTRATE = REC.INTERESTRATE-1
            WHERE LOANID = REC.LOANID; 
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('1% discount applied for Customer ID: ' || REC.CUSTOMERID);
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
    COMMIT;
END;
